# All Learning Plan Resources

Welcome to the Microsoft Global Partner Solutions (GPS) Learning Plan Resources repository, created by the US-based GPS team

## What are Learning Plan Resources?

Learning plan resources consist of curated content to help upskill across solution areas: Azure, Modern Workplace and Business Applications.  

Each solution area is broken down into specific topic areas with specific learning plan resources within each topic. This should make it easy to find the upskilling materials for your areas of interest.

The curated content for each topic consists of fundamental to expert resources to satisfy the needs of anyone that is interested in increasing their knowledge and skills. The resources include links to blogs, documentation, hands-on labs, learning paths, tutorials, videos, webinars and more.

Content is broken down as follows:

* Fundamentals, Associate, Expert, Specialist: content categorized in increasing level of complexity
* Certifications: relevant Microsoft exams or certifications
* Community resources: user groups, events, blogs

## What Types of Resources do Learning Plans Include?

Learning plans include free, paid, first-party, and 3rd-party content.  Microsoft resources found in learning plans commonly include:

**Microsoft Conferences**

Microsoft hosts three major conferences each year: Build, Inspire, and Ignite.  Build is aimed at software engineers and web developers using Windows, Microsoft Azure and other Microsoft technologies.  Microsoft Inspire is Microsoft's largest and most comprehensive partner networking event year after year, allowing partners from around the world to learn about Microsoft's roadmap for the upcoming year, create connections, empower possibilities, and celebrate success.  Microsoft Ignite is aimed at developers and IT professionals and consists of presentation and whiteboard sessions and hands-on labs.

**Microsoft Docs**

Microsoft Docs is the library of technical documentation for end users, developers, and IT professionals who work with Microsoft products. The Microsoft Docs website provides technical specifications, conceptual articles, tutorials, guides, API references, code samples and other information related to Microsoft software and web services.

**Microsoft Learn**

Microsoft Learn is Microsoft's free, online training platform that provides interactive learning for Microsoft products and more.  Microsoft Learn is Microsoft's go-forward learning platform.  Microsoft product groups contribute contribute content to Microsoft Learn covering existing and future products and services.  The list of training courses and modules is extensive.  For hands-on learnings, some Azure learning paths and modules include Exercises.  These Exercises automatically provision an Azure portal for the learner allowing them to learn hands-on without cost or the need to create an Azure account.

**What the Hack**

"What the Hack" is a set of challenge-based hackathons.  When delivered by our architects, attendees work in squads of 3 to 5 people to solve a series of technical challenges for a given technology or solution scenario. Challenges describe high-level tasks and goals to be accomplished. Challenges are not step-by-step labs.  Without step-by-step instructions given for the challenges, attendees have to "figure it out" together as a team. This results in greater knowledge retention for the attendees.
