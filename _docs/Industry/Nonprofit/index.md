This partner readiness material is designed for existing and new partners as they build and grow a business with Microsoft Cloud for Nonprofit - our premier solution for the nonprofit sector. Microsoft Cloud for Nonprofit aligns the capabilities of Microsoft 365, Power Platform, Dynamics 365, Azure, and LinkedIn to address common nonprofit scenarios including constituent engagement and fundraising, staff collaboration and volunteer management, and program design and delivery. Together with our partners we are aiming to double the number of nonprofits we work with to over 600,000 by 2027.
