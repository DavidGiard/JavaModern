# Your first customer implementation of Microsoft Cloud for Nonprofit
Nonprofits need trusted services partners with Microsoft Cloud expertise and industry focus to advise, build, deliver, and support their digital transformation journey.

In addition to a standard deployment and configuration of Fundraising and Engagement or Volunteer Management we encourage you to review this section to ensure successful delivery and identify other opportunities to add value or speed up your customerâ€™s time to value.

## Success by Design
For prescriptive guidance for designing, building, and deploying a Dynamics 365 solution see the [Success by Design Learning Path](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/use-success-design/).

This guidance comes with [20+ examples and templates available on GitHub](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-developer-tools-power-platform/tree/master/fasttrack/) created by our own FastTrack team to use with your customer to prepare and execute your implementation.

With Success by Design, you can engage with project teams through strategic workshops that are aligned to key project stages with clear goals, actions, and deliverables. Each workshop has been designed with specific goals and maps to relevant success measures for the project. A workshop is essentially an alignment exercise that allows the solution architect to assess if best practices are being followed and identify and highlight issues or potential risks that can derail the project.
