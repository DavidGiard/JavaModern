The goal of content in this folder is for each piece of addressable content to be its own file with appropriate metadata. Examples: a video, an article, a blog post, a lab doc, a demo script. 

This piece of content can then be included any pages (in any academy), in feeds, etc. 

Ultimately, a well-formed academy will have "index pages" that act as the glue describing various sections or modules of the academy, while the content pages are created for each piece of content that is programmatically included in each module.
