## Microsoft Partner Onboarding Academy

Once you've created your first offer in the MP, the next step on most partner's journey is to ensure that the solution is Transactable.  

This page will discuss what that means and how to get the most out of it.

### Fundamentals: Create a Transactable Offer

[What is a Transactable offer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace/marketplace-commercial-transaction-capabilities-and-considerations#transact-publishing-option):
A transactable offer is one in which Microsoft facilitates the exchange of money for a software license on the publisherâ€™s behalf. Transact offers are billed against an existing Microsoft subscription or credit card, allowing Microsoft to host cloud marketplace transactions on behalf of the publisher.

To summarize, Transacting through the Marketplace means that billing for your software goes through Microsoft instead of your own invoicing system.

Transactable Offer types:

- Azure Application (Managed application)
- Azure Container
- Azure Virtual Machine
- Software as a service (SaaS)
- Dynamics 365 apps on Dataverse and Power Apps
- Power BI visual
