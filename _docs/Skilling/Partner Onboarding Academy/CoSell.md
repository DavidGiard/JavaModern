## Microsoft Partner Onboarding Academy

Once you've created a transactable offer in the Marketplace, the next step on most partner's journey is to CoSell with Microsoft. In this section you will learn about the differences between Co-sell Ready and IP Co-sell Eligible.



### What is Co-sell

Co-selling is any collaborative engagement between Microsoft and its partner ecosystem, including:
- Building demand
- Sales planning
- Sharing sales leads
- Accelerating partner-to-partner empowered selling
- Delivering marketplace-led commerce

**Co-sell-ready status** exposes your solutions to Microsoft sales teams. Co-selling with Microsoft sales teams and Microsoft partners helps you reach a vast community of Microsoft-managed customers to collaborate on sales opportunities that accelerate your business growth.

**The Azure IP Co-sell eligibility** allows you to submit co-sell referrals and for your offers to contribute toward customersâ€™ Microsoft Azure Consumption Commitments (MACC).


### Co-Sell Ready Requirements

Here are the [Co-Sell Ready Requirements](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/co-sell-requirements#requirements-for-co-sell-ready-status) for an offer:

1. Have Partner ID & Active MP account
2. Completed business Profile in PC
3. Publish Offer in MP
4. Provide sales contact
5. Provide listing & required documents


###  Azure IP Co-Sell Incentive Requirements

   - __PRO TIP__:  Use red box with "IP", use Azure Logos, add bullet points with data flows
4. 50% of the offer's infrastructure uses Azure
5. Offer must be transactable on the Marketplace

### Verify Co-sell Status

[Verify Co-sell Status](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/co-sell-status): make sure user has appropriate permissions to access partner center.
-  Permissions needed: Co-sell solution admin

To verify the co-sell status of a solution, use the following steps:
  1. Sign in to Partner Center and select Referrals.
  2. Select Co-sell solutions.
  - You can verify the current co-sell status and incentives programs your solution is approved for in the grid.
  - You can alternatively select the solution name and open the pane to verify its current status (including if the status is currently under review).
