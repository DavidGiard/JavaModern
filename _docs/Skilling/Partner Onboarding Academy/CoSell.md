## Microsoft Partner Onboarding Academy

Once you've created a transactable offer in the MP, the next step on most partner's journey is to CoSell with Microsoft.



### Fundamentals

Every MP Solution will have a [Co-Sell Status](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/co-sell-requirements#co-sell-statuses) that builds on each other:

- In-Market:
  - Offer is available in MP
- Co-Sell Ready:
  - Offer meets In-Market requirements AND
  - Meets all Co-Sell Ready Requirements (TODO: add link to below page))
- Azure IP co-sell incentive:
  - Offer meets Co-Sell Ready requirements AND
  - Eligible for incentives (e.g. MACC)


### Co-Sell Ready Requirements

Here are the [Co-Sell Ready Requirements](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/co-sell-requirements#requirements-for-co-sell-ready-status) for an offer:
