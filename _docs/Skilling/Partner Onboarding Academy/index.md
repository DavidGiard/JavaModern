#### Welcome to the Microsoft Partner Onboarding Academy, your gateway to TBD. ðŸ“š

*(Some of what you see below is from the Microsoft Security Academy, which is our Repo's most visited/viewed Academy. Hopefully, this gives you inspiration what to include here.)*

Are you ready to onboard as a Microsoft Partner? **[Get started](/PartnerResources/skilling/partner-onboarding-academy/acct)** and take action today.

The Microsoft Partner Onboarding Academy's **Modules** are organized into four sections, including **[Create Partner Center Account](/PartnerResources/skilling/partner-onboarding-academy/acct), [Create Offer](/PartnerResources/skilling/partner-onboarding-academy/offer), [Create Transactable Offer](/PartnerResources/skilling/partner-onboarding-academy/transactable-offer), and [Create MACC Offer](/PartnerResources/skilling/partner-onboarding-academy/macc-offer).** These modules provide a foundation for *TBD*. 

The resources within each module are created by architects across the Global Partner Solutions (GPS) team and beyond, who are experts in their respective fields. Choose the modules that align with your areas of interest to start your journey.
