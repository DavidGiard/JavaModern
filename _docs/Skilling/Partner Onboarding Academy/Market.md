#### Welcome to the Microsoft Partner Onboarding Academy, your gateway to your Partner journey. 

The Microsoft Partner Onboarding Academy's **Modules** are organized into sections which reflect the typical partner journey:

Click on the individual steps below for details:


#### Create and Publish an offer in Partner Center
  - One you have identified the correct offer type for your solution, follow the respective publishing guide. [Publishing Guide by Offer Type](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace/publisher-guide-by-offer-type)
     - Some offer types have different listing options available. For example, if you are publishing a SaaS offer, there are the following listing options:
       
| Listing option   |Transaction process |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Contact me	   | The customer contacts you directly from information in your listing.* You can change to a different listing option after publishing the offer.|
| Free trial  | 	The customer is redirected to your target URL via Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).* You can change to a different listing option after publishing the offer.|  
| Get it now (Free) | The customer is redirected to your target URL via Azure AD.* You can change to a different listing option after publishing the offer. |
| Sell through Microsoft | Offers sold through Microsoft are called transactable offers. An offer that is transactable is one in which Microsoft facilitates the exchange of money for a software license on the publisher's behalf. We bill SaaS offers using the pricing model you choose, and manage customer transactions on your behalf. Azure infrastructure usage fees are billed to you, the partner, directly. You should account for infrastructure costs in your pricing model. This is explained in more detail in SaaS billing below. |  

Note: You cannot change this option once your offer is published.  

TIP: The fastest and easiest offer is a "Contact Me" offer. If your goal is to get something published on the Azure Marketplace ASAP then select a "Contact Me" offer. However, most of the   Co-sell and GTM benefits provided by Microsoft require solutions to be transactable in the Azure Marketplace. This would require a "Sell With Microsoft" offer.

#### Upload Co-Sell Collateral to become "Co-Sell Ready"
Co-selling is any collaborative engagement between Microsoft and its partner ecosystem, including: 
- Building demand 
- Sales planning
- Sharing sales leads
- Accelerating partner-to-partner empowered selling
- Delivering marketplace-led commerce
    
When you choose to co-sell an offer, you can work directly with Microsoft sales teams and Microsoft partners on joint selling opportunities. That unlocks benefits when selling through the commercial marketplace online stores: Azure Marketplace and the Microsoft commercial marketplace.
Follow this guide to configure your solution for co-selling with Microsoft [Configure Co-sell Solution](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/co-sell-configure)
- TIP: There are 3 required documents needed to co-sell with Microsoft.  
    - Solution One Pager  
    - Solution Pitch Deck   
    - Reference Architecture (SaaS Offers Only)
    
Templates for the required documents can be found at [Documents That Support Co-sell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/co-sell-configure#documents-that-support-co-sell)

#### Share Leads With Microsoft
Once your solution is published and co-sell ready, the next step is sharing leads with Microsoft. These are referred to as Co-sell Opportunities. 

In a co-sell opportunity, one or more Microsoft sales representatives actively engage in a deal to help solve a customer problem. Co-sell opportunities can originate from a customer account when a Microsoft sales representative invites a partner to participate in a co-selling activity. Co-sell opportunities can also originate from a partner who needs more help from Microsoft sales to close a deal.

Follow this webpage to learn how to upload opportunities: [Manage Co-sell Opportunities](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/manage-co-sell-opportunities). 

#### Understand Marketplace Rewards
As you begin to sell through the Azure Marketplace, you are able to take advantage of Sales and Marketing benefits provided by Microsoft. Microsoft offers many programs for Partners. Membership workspace in Partner Center is a single stop shop where you can manage multiple membership of yours with Microsoft. We offer multiple programs for different types of partners [Partner Programs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/mpn-overview#explore-different-tracks). Different memberships come with different benefits provided by Microsoft. These benefits can be redeemed from Benefits workspace (including Azure Credits, Cloud Services, Software Keys, Technical consultation, Developer Tools, Marketing Benefits & Logo Builder).
