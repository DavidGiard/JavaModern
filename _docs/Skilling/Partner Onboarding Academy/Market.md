Click on the individual steps below for details:


#### Create and Publish an offer in Partner Center
  - One you have identified the correct offer type for your solution, follow the respective publishing guide. [Publishing Guide by Offer Type](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace/publisher-guide-by-offer-type)
     - Some offer types have different listing options available. For example, if you are publishing a SaaS offer, there are the following listing options:
     -Insert pic 
     - TIP: The fatest and easiest offer is a "Contact Me" offer. If your goal is to get something published on the Azure Marketplace ASAP then select a "Contact Me" offer. However, most of the Co-sell and GTM benefits provided by Microsoft require solutions to be transactable in the Azure Marketplace. This would require a "Sell With Microsoft" offer. 

#### Upload Co-Sell Collateral to become "Co-Sell Ready"
Co-selling is any collaborative engagement between Microsoft and its partner ecosystem, including: 
- Building demand 
- Sales planning
- Sharing sales leads
- Accelerating partner-to-partner empowered selling
- Delivering marketplace-led commerce
    
When you choose to co-sell an offer, you can work directly with Microsoft sales teams and Microsoft partners on joint selling opportunities. That unlocks benefits when selling through the commercial marketplace online stores: Azure Marketplace and the Microsoft commercial marketplace.
Follow this guide to configure your solution for co-selling with Microsoft [Configure Co-sell Solution](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/co-sell-configure)
- TIP: There are 3 required documents needed to co-sell with Microsoft.  
    - Solution One Pager  
    - Solution Pitch Deck   
    - Reference Architecture (SaaS Offers Only)
    
Templates for the required documents can be found at [Documents That Support Co-sell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/co-sell-configure#documents-that-support-co-sell)

#### Share Leads With Microsoft
Once your solution is published and co-sell ready, the next step is sharing leads with Microsoft. These are reffered to as Co-sell Opportunities. 

In a co-sell opportunity, one or more Microsoft sales representatives actively engage in a deal to help solve a customer problem. Co-sell opportunities can originate from a customer account when a Microsoft sales representative invites a partner to participate in a co-selling activity. Co-sell opportunities can also originate from a partner who needs more help from Microsoft sales to close a deal.

Follow this webpage to learn how to upload opportunities: [Manage Co-sell Opportunities](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/manage-co-sell-opportunities).
