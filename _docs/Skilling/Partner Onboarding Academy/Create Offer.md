## Microsoft Partner Onboarding Academy

**After creating a Microsoft Partner Center account and receiving your MPN ID, your next step in the journey is to Create an Offer.**  This page will walk you through the important concepts necessary to create your first offer in Partner Center.

### Create an Offer in Partner Center

To create an offer, you must select the following. This page will walk you through the different options.

- [Select a Listing Type](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace/determine-your-listing-type)
- [Select an Offer Type](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace/publisher-guide-by-offer-type)
- [Select a Plan](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/pricing-and-offers)
- [Submit Offer for review](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace/review-publish-offer)

### Offer Listing Type Options

An offer must have one of 4 different listing types:

- [Free Trial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace/determine-your-listing-type#free-trial): Make a software license available free for 30 to 120 days. (Customers will be charged for applicable Azure infrastructure usage)
- [Test Drive](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace/determine-your-listing-type#test-drive)
- [Contact Me](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace/determine-your-listing-type#contact-me): A simple list of the offer which allows a potential customer to contact you. Can be used to [generate customer leads](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace/partner-center-portal/commercial-marketplace-get-customer-leads).
- [Get It Now](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace/determine-your-listing-type#get-it-now): The only way to "Transact in Marketplace." Must be one of the following licenses: 
    - [Free](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace/determine-your-listing-type#get-it-now-free): Not Marketplace Transactable
    - [Bring Your Own License (BYOL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace/determine-your-listing-type#bring-your-own-license-byol): Not Marketplace Transactable
    - [Subscription](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace/determine-your-listing-type#subscription): Charge a flat fee for monthly or annual subscriptions
    - [Usage Based Pricing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace/determine-your-listing-type#usage-based-pricing): Used to define custom or pre-defined billing metrics and rates (e.g., per vCPU, per seat, usage billing, etc.)
 
__PRO TIP__: Many partners start with "Contact Me" offer to get started.


### Offer Types

A technical portion of an offer will fall into one of the following Offer Types:

- [SaaS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace/plan-saas-offer)
- [Azure Container](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace/marketplace-containers)
- [Virtual Machines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace/marketplace-virtual-machines)
- [Azure Applications](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace/plan-azure-application-offer)
- [Dynamics 365](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace/marketplace-dynamics-365)
- [Managed Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace/plan-managed-service-offer)
- [Consulting Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace/plan-consulting-service-offer)
- [And more!](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace/publisher-guide-by-offer-type#list-of-offer-types)

Here are additional details about other Offer Types:

### [Offer Type - SaaS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace/plan-saas-offer)

To integrate your SaaS with the MP, there are a few, great resources to get you started:

- [Mastering the Marketplace](https://microsoft.github.io/Mastering-the-Marketplace/saas/tech-topics/): Walkthrough of creating SaaS offer
- [SaaS Accelerator](https://microsoft.github.io/Mastering-the-Marketplace/saas-accelerator/): Provides a functional, technical implementation for SaaS solutions for getting started

### [Offer Type - Azure Container](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace/marketplace-containers) 

[Azure Container Offers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace/azure-container-technical-assets-kubernetes) (a.k.a. Kubernetes Apps) offers are for solutions which can run inside an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster. Microsoft hosts your container images and helm chart, deploys them into Customer AKS cluster, and manages billing.

### Private vs Public Plans

When creating the offer, you might want to offer a different pricing model for customers that are not publicly available.  This page will talk about the different options:

- [Private Plans](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/private-plans) - A custom pricing plan for an Offer for a specific Tenant or Subscription

- [Private Offers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace/isv-customer) - Similar to Private Plans, but cover more scenarios (e.g., discounts, expiration dates, bundles, custom terms). Note that a private offer still requires a public offer and a public plan with a price. The pricing and terms will be updated in the private offer.

A good guide that compares the two options can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace/isv-customer-faq)

__PRO TIP__: When possible, use a Private Offer. Creating a private plan requires your offer to go through certification again and takes more time.
