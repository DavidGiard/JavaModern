description: Itâ€™s difficult to not only build a 24/7 Security Operations Center (SOC) but also to successfully onboard customers and employees, automate incident remediation, and proactively hunt for threats. ContraForce is simplifying security operations with their first-of-kind platform that empowers even the most entry-level of analysts to onboard, respond to incidents, and then automate their incident remediation. Listen to Stan and Ricky, the CEO and CTO of ContraForce, talk about their platform, its unique value, and more.
