This video titled **Working with Segments** shows you how to use Segments in Customer Insights â€“ Journeys.

Segments help marketers reach the right audience for their marketing campaigns. You can create segments with a simple and powerful logic builder that works with any data structure and operator, without needing any special skills.

And, with Copilot feature enabled, you create segments faster and easier. You type the segment criteria and Copilot will suggest the best logic for you. For example, if you want to create a segment of customers who have purchased more than $1000 worth of products in the last 30 days, you can type that into the Segment builder.
