## **Copilot** 
Copilot in Power Apps can now build complex multi-screen apps and turn unstructured inputs into structured data. These advancements include the ability to use Copilot to add and edit any screen or mainline control to an app; the ability to understand unstructured Excel files as inputs and turn them into structured data; and the ability for developers to add an advanced Copilot control to model apps for end users that can reason over all the data in their application. While makers have already seen the power of Copilot in creating and editing tables, this new iteration can interpret unstructured data and create complex multi-screen applications through the power of natural language.

## **Azure OpenAI Service model** 
The Azure OpenAI Service generative text capability is a powerful tool in AI Builder. It allows you to create custom AI capabilities quickly and easily for natural language processing (NLP). This capability enables you to build scenarios such as summarization, information extraction, autogenerate response, classification, translation, and more. It also allows you to use large language models to generate new text, which can be used for a variety of purposes.
