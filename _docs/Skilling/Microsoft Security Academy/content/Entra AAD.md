sorttitle: 1
description: This session covers Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and its various authentication methods such as password-based, multi-factor, and certificate-based authentication. Learn about Single Sign-On (SSO) and Hybrid Identity, which allows organizations to extend their on-premises Active Directory environment to Azure AD. Another focus of the session is on Azure AD Identity Secure Score, Conditional Access, and Identity Protection, which are vital tools for securing user identities and access to resources in the cloud. These tools enable organizations to enforce adaptive access policies, detect and respond to identity-based risks in real-time, and improve the overall security posture of their Azure AD environment.
