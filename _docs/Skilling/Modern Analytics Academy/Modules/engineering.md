# Modern Analytics Academy - Data Engineering

Data Engineering explores topics related to the infrastructure and systems that process data. In our original series, we referred to this as "Data Pipelines." These topics focus on data movement in Synapse Pipelines, Azure Data Factory, and Fabric Data Engineering (which encompasses Fabric Data Factory, data pipelines, and Spark/notebooks). Data Engineering often overlaps with storage and modeling, particularly with Lakehouse implementations, so we'll include topics related to data modeling. We'll also include material related to observability and monitoring.

## "Vignette" Sessions 

Our ongoing Modern Analytics Academy series, which we've called "vignettes", dive into topical areas related to analytics. For a complete list of sessions, visit the
