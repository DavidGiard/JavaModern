# Modern Analytics Academy - Data Science

Data Science explores topics related to data enrichment and getting value from data, historically referred to as "business intelligence." This often overlaps with integration and modeling, and often machine learning algorithms. However, the data cleansing, enrichment, and modeling techniques are often unique to data science when compared to other business analytics. For more in-depth AI and ML related topics, see our [AI and ML Academy](/PartnerResources/skilling/ai-ml-academy).
