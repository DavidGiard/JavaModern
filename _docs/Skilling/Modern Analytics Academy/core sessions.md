# Modern Analytics Academy - Core Sessions

The Modern Analytics Academy core sessions, listed below, consist of the original sessions that walk through a modern analytics solution (created prior to the introduction Microsoft Fabric), from data creation/ingestion through warehousing and visualization. Each session is designed to be stand-alone, but also part of a cohesive architecture.

Our ongoing Modern Analytics Academy series, which we've called "vignettes", dive into topical areas related to analytics. For a more immersive list of sessions, visit the 
[vignette page](/PartnerResources/skilling/modern-analytics-academy/vignettes) for an expanded list with descriptions and thumbmails.
