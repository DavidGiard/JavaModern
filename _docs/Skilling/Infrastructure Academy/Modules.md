## Microsoft Infrastructure Academy

### ModulesðŸ“˜

The Microsoft Infrastructure Academy's **[Modules](/PartnerResources/skilling/microsoft-infrastructure-academy/modules)** are organized into four smaller infrastructure modules, including [Migrate and Secure Windows & SQL Servers](/PartnerResources/skilling/microsoft-infrastructure-academy/windows-sql-servers), [SAP on Azure](/PartnerResources/skilling/microsoft-infrastructure-academy/sap-on-azure), [Enable Customer Success](/PartnerResources//skilling/microsoft-infrastructure-academy/enable-customer-success), and [AI Infrastructure (HPC)](/PartnerResources/skilling/microsoft-infrastructure-academy/ai-infrastructure). These modules lay the foundation for developing proficiency in Azure infrastructure. 

The resources within each academy are created and delivered by architects across the Global Partner Solutions (GPS) security-aligned team and beyond, who are experts in their respective fields.
