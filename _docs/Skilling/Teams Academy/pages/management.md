# Microsoft Teams Academy - Management

Welcome to the Management bucket in the Teams Academy. Here we will dig into all things related to Teams foundations, Administration, and Operations. Things like how teams leverages Exchange/SharePoint/Azure, provisioning, policies, group assignments, RBAC, Call Quality Dashboard and analytics, Admin tools, and more!

Any embedded resources that needed to added to the repo directly, such as PPTX or images, should be housed in the root assets folder in a subfolder with a short name. For example, Modern Analytics Academy has content in /assets/maa/filename.pptx; this is necessary to support Github pages deployment. Ideally, video content should be embedded or linked to. See the Modern Analytics Academy for samples on how to do this.

__Important!__ Don't forget to update the 'front-matter' at the top of the document (the content between ---). Update the name and permalink -- remember each page needs a unqiue permalink. See how the template simply addes to the permalink with the sub page name.
