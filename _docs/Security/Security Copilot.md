# Learning Plan Resources for Security Copilot

> This document is under active development. Please check regularly for updates.

## Introduction

Microsoft Security Copilot is an AI-powered security analysis tool that enables analysts to respond to threats quickly, process signals at machine speed, and assess risk exposure in minutes. We first introduced Security Copilot at the inaugural Microsoft Secure. Microsoft Security Copilot is the first security product to enable defenders to move at the speed and scale of AI. It combines the most advanced large language models (LLMs) from OpenAI with a Microsoft-developed, security-specific model. 

* Simplify the complex — During an attack, complexity can cost you. Synthesize data from multiple sources into clear, actionable insights and respond to incidents in minutes instead of hours or days.
* Catch what others miss — Triage signals at machine speed, surface threats early, and get predictive guidance to help you thwart an attacker’s next move.
* Address the talent gap — The demand for skilled defenders vastly exceeds the supply. Help your team make the most impact and build their skills with step-by-step instructions for mitigating risks.


Microsoft Security Copilot is currently in preview and not yet generally available. [Sign up for Microsoft Security updates](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p?linkid=2228156) to learn about product announcements, security insights, and upcoming events.

## Features
### Security Copilot Integrations

Security Copilot integrates insights and data from other critical security tools:

* [Microsoft Sentinel](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/siem-and-xdr/microsoft-sentinel)
* [Microsoft Defender](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/microsoft-defender)
* [Microsoft Intune](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/microsoft-Intune)

Security Copilot runs on Microsoft Security and privacy-compliant hyperscale infrastructure. The unique foundation leverages the full benefit of Azure, and our cyber-trained model creates a learning system that has a set of security-specific skills that are constantly growing. Combine that with Microsoft’s evergreen global threat intelligence and Security Copilot’s end-to-end integration and tooling and we can change the equation. With a growing ecosystem of third-party products and services, Security Copilot enables organizations to truly defend at machine speed.

Microsoft Security Copilot will serve as the heart of our security solutions and be the central location where our products come together. We envision increased opportunities for cross-product scenarios (e.g., such as viewing endpoint and identity alerts in the same experience).
